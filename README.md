# multi_label_text_classification
Multi-label text classification

The aim of this project is to classify input samples from the Ronash dataset into 20 distinct categories using information such as their title, vendor, and tags. To achieve this goal, various text processing techniques such as text tokenizing, vectorization, and embedding are utilized. Additionally, the project explores the application of hyperparameter tuning and decision tree tuning methods to improve the classification accuracy. Various LSTM and RNN models were also tested in this project.
