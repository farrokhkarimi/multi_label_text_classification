## Significant Performance Boost in Multi-Label Text Classification Model: Accuracy Increased to 84.25% and Loss Reduced to 0.654
***In this notebook i presents an updated version of the multi-label text classification model developed by Farrokh Karimi. The original model achieved an accuracy of 81.21% and a loss of 0.8373.*** In this updated version, we made several changes to improve the model's performance, including adjusting the batch size and the maximum sequence length, modifying the feature extraction process, and exploring different deep learning architectures. As a result, the best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 84.25% and a loss of 0.654, representing a significant improvement over the original model. In addition, we tested several new models and found that the model with convolutional layers achieved an accuracy of 82.16%, while the model with transformer blocks achieved an accuracy of 82.73%, both outperforming the original model. We hope that these enhancements will provide valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of natural language processing. Please feel free to review our updates and provide feedback via the pull request or comments section.
